## Git Branching Policies:
# Git Flow

## Introduction:
If you are new to git and/or to repository management, you have probably never heard of branching policies or what a branching policy is.
A branching policy is a set of rules which help organise and make it easy to keep everything in your repository working as intended.

In this page we are going to talk about the 'Git Flow' model, which was depeloped from the [initial proposal by Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

***

### Basic Structure
The Git Flow workflow consists of two main branches: ```master``` and ```develop```. These two branches will be existent from the start of the development and should not be worked on directly, instead, modifications and new features will be developed in separate branches and, after they are finished and verified, merged into them.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/marc094/GitFlowClass/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
